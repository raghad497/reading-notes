## **JS Object Literals; The DOM**

## **Object Literals** :

## JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means “early” in German) could be used as a variable name. JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python. Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.  JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code .

## **The DOM :**
+ ## DOM stands for document object model The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

+ ## A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.



## **WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE :**
## Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:

+ ## Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
+ ## bUse its text content, child elements, and attributes.

## **Caching Dom Queries** :
+ ## They are the methods that find elements in the DOM tree.
+ ## They may return one element or collection of nodes (NodeList).
+ ## getElementById() and querySelector() can both search an entire document and return individual elements.
+ ## getElementById() allows you to select a single element node by specifying the value of its id attribute.


## **Why problem domains are hard ?**

+ ## The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all. The real world is a messy place. Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

+ ## As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it.

## **Important :**
## **The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:**

+ ## The HTML elements as objects
+ ## The properties of all HTML elements
+ ## The methods to access all HTML elements *- The events for all HTML elements
+ ## In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get,- change, add, or delete HTML elements.

## HOW TO REMOVE ELEMENTS VIA DOM MANIPULATION ?

+ ## STORE THE ELEMENT TO BE REMOVED IN A VARIABLE
+ ## STORE THE PARENT OF THAT ELEMENT IN A VARIABLE
+ ## REMOVE THE ELEMENT FROM ITS CONTA INING ELEMENT
