## Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another ,Links are created using the element. The element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs. You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the “to” field. You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to .

## Layouts :


## CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

## Question :how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts?

## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

## How do we use functions ? 
## 1 ) Declaring a function : 
## To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.

## 2) Calling a function :
## Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function.


## pair programming :

## Pair programming: is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Benefits of pair programming :
+ ## Learning from fellow students
+ ## Social skills
+ ## Job interview readiness
