## **CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS :**

+ ## In normal flow: each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way.

+ ## position: static;

+ ## Relative positioning : moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

+ ## position:relative

+ ## When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page

+ ## position: absolute;

+ ## Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.

+ ## position:fixed

## Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position values, and how to use them.


## **Screen Sizes :** 

## Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

## **CSS Frameworks:**
## CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
