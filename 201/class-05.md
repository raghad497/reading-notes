+ ## Image Resolution : Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.
+ ## Vector Images : Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

## **COLOR** :

## The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

## rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

## hex codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

## **Important NOTES :** 
+ ## Color can really bring your pages to life . 
+ ## Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
+ ## CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Some important tips about text in HTML : 

+ ## There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
+ ## There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
+ ## If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
+ ## You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
+ ## You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.


## **JPEG & PNG & GIF** :

## 1) JPEG is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality. Beyond this, the compression artefacts become more prominent.

## 2) PNG is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image. For this reason, a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, it would also occupy more space on the disk.

## 3) GIF is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm. It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing.
