# **Structural markup and Semantic Markup**

## **Headings**
### **HTML has six levels of headings: h1 is used for main headings h2 is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the h3 element is used, and so on ...**

## **Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**
### **As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag And of course to create a break between themes such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the hr tag..**

## **Semantic mark up**

### **In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code , for example “what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?” , or “what purpose or role does that HTML element have**

### **The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element and there are three ways to desighn with css :**

+ ### **Inline style**


+ ### **internal style**

+ ### **external style**


## **Let's see some Examples in using css :**

## **Running JAVASCRIPT in the HTML :**
![](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/deep-cloning-objects-javascript.png)

### **When the browser comes across a script  element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.**

## **Question : How do I write a script for a wab page?**
+ ### **It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the js extension**\

+ ### **The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather likethe link element can be used to load a CSS file).**

+ ### **If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created .**

## **STATEMENTS : A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.**

## **COMMENTS : You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand.This can help you and others who read your code.**

## **VARIABLES : A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.**

## **Question : How to declare variables and assign values to them ?**

## **Let's check out JS data types?**

## **FUNCTIONS,MITHODS & OBJECTS :**

+ ### **Functions allow you to group a set of relatedstatements together that represent a single task.**

+ ### **Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ requiredto do their job) and may return a value.**

+ ### **An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.**

+ ### **JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.**

+ ### **Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets.**

## **comparison operators: you can evaluate asituation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be and the result will be a boolean : True or false**
