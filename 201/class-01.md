## **The Evolution of HTML**

### **Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML:**

+ ### **HTML 4 (Released 1997)**
+ ### **XHTML 1.0 (Released 2000)**
+ ### **HTML 5 (Released 2000)**

## **Using HTML:**

+ ### **DOCTYPES :**
### *Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using .*

+ ### **Comments in HTML:**
### *If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:*
<!-- comment goes here -->


+ ### **ID Attribute:**

### *Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore .*

+ ### **Class Attribute**
### *Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.*

+ ### **Block Elements :**
### *Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.*

+ ### **Inline Elements:**
### *Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.*

## **WireFrames**
### **A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.**
