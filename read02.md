# **What is Git ?**
### **Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes we make to files, so you have a record of what has been done all the time, and we can revert to specific versions should we ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source .**
