## **For Statement :**

### **A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false and we can assign a specific number of times to do it .**
### * **It comes in the Form :** *
+ **for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement**

## **While Statement :** 

### **A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true and we can leave it without assigning a number of times to do it , unlike for statement .**

### * **It comes in the Form :** *
+ **while (condition)
  statement**
